# QtPy Block Coding Interface

## Introduction
This project is a block coding interface built with QtPy, which allows users to drag and drop blocks representing different functions into a workspace and execute a sequence of these functions by hitting a 'Start' button.

## Features
- Drag and drop functionality to arrange functional blocks
- Customizable blocks with user-defined functions
- Sequential execution of blocks
- QtPy-based GUI for easy manipulation and visualization
